This analysis was done by taking the average score of all conditions treated
per hospital, ranking the hospitals in descending order, and then taking the
top 10 results.

The average of all condition scores serves as a general metric to rate each
hospital based on treated conditions.  While a more accurate metric would
be to count the unique conditions each hospital treats, take the average
of each condition per hospital, and then compare those two metrics among
hospitals (the number of conditions treated and the average score for each
condition) using some sort of weight system, this serves as a good baseline
metric for evaluating hospitals at a glance.  Furthermore, the sample size
is important as well in rating a hospital, something that is not taken into
account as part of this "at a glance" analysis.
