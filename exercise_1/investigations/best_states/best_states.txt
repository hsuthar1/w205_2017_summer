This analysis was done by taking the average score of all conditions treated
per state, ranking the states in descending order, and then taking the
top 10 results.

The average of all condition scores serves as a general metric to rate each
state based on treated conditions.  While a more accurate metric would
be to count the unique conditions each hospital in each state treats, take the
average of each condition per hospital, and then compare those two metrics among
states (the number of conditions treated and the average score for each
condition) using some sort of weight system, this serves as a good baseline
metric for evaluating states at a glance.  Furthermore, the sample size
is important as well in rating a state, something that is not taken into
account as part of this "at a glance" analysis.
